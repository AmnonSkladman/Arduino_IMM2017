Arduino ChaseMe Robot
============================
By Amnon Skladman & Nicole Yu

1. A. First, you'll want to get a robot chassis with wheels, preferably three, but two works as well (if it's well balanced).
1. B. You'll want to make sure it has two DC motors attached to the two main wheels, because you'll be connecting them to the Arduino's breadboards.

2. You need to get yourself a sonar and three microphones. We used the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor and [SparkFun Sound Detector] to give our robot sound triangulation abilities, as well as collision detection.

3. Attach the sonar and three microphones to breadboards, and connect those to your Arduino. We put each microphone and sonar onto their own breadboards, so we used 4 breadboards in total.

4. Copy the attached code, verify it, and upload it to your Arduino. Make sure the inputs and outputs in the code match the ones you have connected on your Arduino.

5. You should now have a robot that chases you. Whether it's a dog, or an Internet-born monster, you'll now have to keep quiet if you don't want to be chased. Enjoy!
